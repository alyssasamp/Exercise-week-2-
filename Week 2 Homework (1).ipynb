    "#For this, I used float in order for them to input any amount of each of the categories which are the lengths, and spaces. I left a space out with a \":\" where they type in a number and had to label each little equation its assigned number that it lined up as on the homework problem. Then I typed int he equation the problem wanted us to use to solve it and lastly used the print function to type out the final answer. Once that was coded, I was able to enter any numbers so I decided to use \"5\" for all of them, and with using the code, it gave me an output of 3. This means the final answer for my coding problem and the number of grapevines is 3. \n",
